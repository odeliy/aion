        users may have we recommend first connecting with the community on
        <a href="#">Reddit</a>. In the unlikely scenario that the community is

          <p class="faq__a hidden" id="a11">
            When using your Ledger hardware wallet with Aion installed to access
            an account VIA the Chrome browser, users will need to enable the
            Aion contract on their Ledger device. This can be done by selecting:
            Aion > Setting > enable Contract.

          </h4>
          <p class="faq__a hidden" id="a12">
            Aiwa was owned and operated by a third-party organization called
            BlockX Labs, Aiwa was funded by a community grant during its
            lifespan. However, BlockX Labs is now reorganizing and will no
            longer support Aiwa. Usage of Aiwa has decreased significantly with
            other tools such as the web based wallet now available so the
            decision was made to deprecate it.

            In order to undelegate your Aion: <br />
            – You must have a sufficient Aion balance to perform the
            undelegation transaction (a minimum of 0.02 Aion is required for the
            transaction fee) <br />– Your balance will be updated after a
            lock-up period of 8640 blocks (approximately 24 hours) <br />–
            Ensure the amount follows this format: 999,999,999.999999999 <br />–
            If you are using a ledger, please ensure that your firmware is up to
            date. <br />– If you are using the desktop interface, ensure that
            you are using the <a href="#">latest version</a> <br />– For more

          </h4>
          <p class="faq__a hidden" id="a14">
            As of January 31, 2022 swapping from ERC20 to Aion mainnet is no
            longer supported. The original Aion token swap from Ethereum to Aion
            was completed on December 10, 2018. However, in order to support the
            community members who missed the original swap deadline a manual
            process was available, this process has now been retired.
